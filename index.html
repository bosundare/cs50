  <p> Hi everyone, Welcome to my page. All information is only for assignment and testing purpose.
  I have had some fun growing up in Nigeria with divorced parents. Some of my challenge started from when my parents seperated
  at a tender age. At this time, I was in high school when my parents seperated.

<p> I had a touch childhood or simply a rough one, however, I was sent to the boarding school for my high school
  for six years. I also learned quite a lot during my high school days. Although, I must say
  it was fun for me.</p>
  <p>In addition, I had two siblings. They both stayed at my mother's house during my days in high school.
  They always ensured that I had good friends in school.</p>
  <p>As an adult, I made lots of life's decisions during my adulthood, most of which was done during
  my school days while enrolled in high school. I had to get a girl friend just to keep me busy and always trying to stay
out of trouble. I loved all my family members and also my sibling. </p>
<p>Eventually, my dad and step mom won the Visa lottery, and they moved to the United States in 2004. Back in September of same
year, I also travelled to the US in order to be with them while I was in College. But one of the great mistakes I made was
coming back to Nigeria to finish my school. </p>
<p>After my trip, I was determined to finish travel back to the US. Immediately after my schooling, I purchased an air ticket
and travelled to the US. This was the beginning of my lifetime in the United States - May 2007. Check out other pages.</p>
