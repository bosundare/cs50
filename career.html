<h1 class="text-center">Start of My Career</h1>
<div id="first">
  <p> As soon as I enrolled in the US Navy, I waited at home and did other menial jobs as there was some few months
    of delaying. This delay was due to waiting period prior to being shipped to bootcamp at the Recruit Training Center
    at Chicago. I did two months at Navy boot camp with numerous drills. After which I was shipped to school to be an
    electrician in order to study foy my job rate in the US Navy. I also served on the USS Bataan as an Electrician.
  <p>Spending 4 years in the US Navy, I figured it was time to move on to another part of my career. As such,
  I left the US navy after 4 years to become an Electrician for Bridgestone Firestone. During my time at Bridgestone,
I enrolled in school to study towards my degree in IT and Networking in order for me to shift my career focus to IT.
