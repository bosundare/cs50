<h1 class="text-center">All About Me</h1>
<div id="first">
  <p> Much about me was when I came into the United States. It was quite a jolly ride with quite a lot of
    ups and downs during my first few months in the United State. During my first few months, I was unable to get
    a decent paying job with my Chemistry degree, so I just had to resort to doing some other menial jobs
    jsut to make ends meet and fulfil my dream of earning some top dollars.

<p> Some of the menial jobs I did was to work as a dog walker. Although, I was not a pet-friendly type of person,
however, I was quite desperate to earn some money. Because of this, I had to walk dogs and also take care of cats.</p>
  <p>During the day, I was a security guard working at H&M, while at night, I was an animal sitter, taking
  care of people's dog. </p>
    <p>However, there was a time I was working as a security or what is usually known as Theft Prevention.
  One of the customer's tag was beeping. I was going to stop the customer, however, she
thought I was grabbing her bag, so she slapped me right in the face. </p>
<p>This was when I decided it was time for me to move on to another career. I quit my job that same day
and I decided to join the US Navy as an Electrician. This was the beginning of my career in the United States. </p>
